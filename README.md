This repository contains several examples of data visualization using "Grid" package in R.

## Bias in 2000 Olympic Diving Game

* This visualization is about bias from 20 judges in 2000 Olympic diving game.
* For each judge from different countries, I calculated how biased they were when they judged on divings, and their p-values.
* The visualization was finished with R package *Grid*.
